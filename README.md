# Pet Food Generator

### Purpose
I created this project to better build my dog's and my cat's homemade food recipes, based on the following standard:

* [AAFCO Dog and Cat Food Nutrient Profiles](https://www.google.com/search?q=aafco+nutrient+requirements+for+dogs&oq=aafco+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j35i39i650j0i20i263i512j0i20i131i263i433i512j0i512l6.13155j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
* [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)

This project talks to USDA REST api to get nutrition facts of ingredients, calculates and compares the result with AAFCO standard.

### Progress
* just started. 

### Tech Space
* PostgreSQL
* Springboot
* Front end: TBD. I don't really know front end. Maybe I'll just do jsp.
